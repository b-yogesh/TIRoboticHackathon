A Smart Parking Robot is a robot vehicle that circles around the city the whole day long searching for free parking slots. The collected data are mapped and are immediately available in the app. This enables users to search for parking nearby their current location, drive directly to the free parking and save the time and energy. 

This project uses RLSK MAX kit to show a preview of features our bot has. The robot was programmed to drive only over a white surface and stop when stepping over the black surface (since we only have abundance of white papers). For this we used the 8 IR sensors located at the bottom of the RLSK MAX. Further on, the robot is programmed to follow the track and look for free parking spot - a spot without an obstacle on it. The obstacle was detected using the 6 bumbers in front. After finding the free parking spot, the robot celebrates which corresponds to data being uploaded to the app for. 

We would like to thank FTL(https://www.femaletechleaders.org/) and TI([https://www.ti.com/) for sending us the robots and giving us the oppurtunity to work on such fun project.
